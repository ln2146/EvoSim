"""Global control flags for runtime features.

These flags are intended to be the *single source of truth* for
runtime switches that affect the simulation and related components.

They are mutated in three main ways:
    • CLI / terminal choices in main.py
    • HTTP control API (FastAPI in main.py)
    • Standalone tools such as opinion_balance_launcher.py

Simulation code and launchers should *only* look at these flags when
deciding whether to run malicious attacks, post‑hoc intervention, etc.

# True  -> enable all malicious attack logic
# False -> completely disable malicious attacks

# This flag controls the third-party fact checking system.
#
# True  -> enable third-party fact checking (_run_fact_checking_async)
# False -> completely disable third-party fact checking

# NOTE: Truth appending (_append_truth_to_fake_news_posts_with_delay) 
# executes unconditionally and is NOT controlled by this flag.

# True  -> enable moderation system (visibility degradation, warning labels, takedowns)
# False -> completely disable moderation system

# - Warning labels: marking content with official warnings
# - Hard takedowns: removing posts and banning users
